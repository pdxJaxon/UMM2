# UMockMe (2)

Description pending

### Config
UMockMe uses [dotenv]: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv> 
for configuration. Default configuration settings are found in 
the `/.env` file. You can override these settings while running 
locally by including overrides in a `/.env.local` file. All "local" 
files are gitignored so your local customized settings are all yours.
